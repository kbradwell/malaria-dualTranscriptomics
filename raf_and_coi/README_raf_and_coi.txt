1. use genomic regions (excluding multigene families) and pileup files to obtain reference allele frequencies (RAFs) with pileupRAFsExcludeRegions_v2
2. use the R package moimix along with vcf files from selected snp calling method to obtain Fws values with moimix_getFws
3. plot histograms of RAFs overlaid with the Fws values with plot_RAFs_FwsVals_v2
